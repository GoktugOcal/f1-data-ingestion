# python-signalr-client
**Python** signalR client using asyncio.

That module is based on the [repository](https://github.com/slazarov/python-signalr-client) of [Stanislav Lazarov](https://github.com/slazarov), thanks for the work!

That repository has been archived on Oct 13, 2023. So, we have duplicated it.
